In this project I will be using docker compose to build a python app image on top of a python base image and running mongodb from the dockerhub on a separete container. This project is almost the same as the previous 3.python-custom (which was to run each dockorfile separately). However the difference is that Docker compose file is a way to declaratively orchestrate the startup of multiple containers and therefore automatically creates images, runs containers and creates network bridges according to what is specified in the docker compose file with a simple command. 

On the docker compose file there is a version number, which is the latest version of docker compose being used. The services tells us what we going to start and use. In this case two services/containers will be used app and mongo.
